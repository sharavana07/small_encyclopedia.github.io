        <h2>Giant Pandas</h2>
        <p>
            Giant pandas are one of the most recognizable and beloved animals in the world. Native to China, these large bears are known for their distinct black and white fur. Giant pandas primarily feed on bamboo, which constitutes the majority of their diet. Despite their large size, they are known for their gentle and solitary nature.

        <h2>Why Giant Pandas Are Important</h2>
        <p>
            Giant pandas play a crucial role in their ecosystem as bamboo forests depend on their activities to remain healthy. Their feeding habits help control bamboo growth and promote the growth of other plant species. Additionally, giant pandas are a symbol of wildlife conservation efforts, representing numerous endangered species worldwide.

        <p>
            Red pandas are smaller than giant pandas and are native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. They have a reddish-brown coat with a long, bushy tail and are known for their arboreal lifestyle, spending most of their time in trees. Red pandas are also known for their playful and curious nature.
