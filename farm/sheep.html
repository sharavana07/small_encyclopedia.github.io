            <p>Sheep are highly valued farm animals known for their wool, meat (mutton), and milk. In India, sheep farming is an important rural activity that supports millions of livelihoods, especially in semi-arid and arid regions. Indian sheep breeds are well adapted to local environments and play a crucial role in the country’s agrarian economy.</p>

            <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Sheep are medium-sized animals with a robust and compact build. They have a thick coat of wool, which varies in color from white to brown, depending on the breed. Their heads are typically narrow with small ears, and most breeds have horns, though some are polled (hornless). Indian breeds like the Deccani, Nellore, and Marwari are known for their hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>

            <p>Sheep are herbivores, primarily grazing on grass, but they also consume a variety of herbs, shrubs, and leaves. In India, sheep are often fed crop residues like wheat and rice straw, along with supplementary feed during dry seasons. Their diet is crucial for wool quality and meat production. Sheep have a ruminant digestive system, allowing them to efficiently process fibrous plant material.</p>

            <p>Sheep are social animals that prefer to live in flocks. They are known for their strong flocking instinct, which makes them easier to manage. Sheep communicate through vocalizations and body language. They are generally docile but can be wary of predators. In India, sheep are often herded by shepherds and guard dogs, especially in rural areas.</p>

            <h2>Importance in Indian Agriculture</h2>
            <p>Sheep are a vital component of Indian agriculture, especially in regions where crop farming is challenging. They provide wool, which is a significant raw material for the textile industry, and mutton, which is a primary source of protein for many communities. Sheep farming in India also contributes to organic farming by providing manure, which enriches soil fertility. The adaptability of Indian sheep breeds makes them an essential resource for sustainable farming practices.</p>
